            <!-- General Information -->
            <h3>You Should Know</h3>
            <p>
                The "FIN" (Failure From Incomplete) grade is assigned when a student fails to meet the deadline for an 
                <a href="inc_grade.html" target="_blank">"INC" grade</a>.
                The "INC" deadline can be found on the BMCC
                <a href="https://www.bmcc.cuny.edu/academics/academic-calendar/spring-regular-2024/#:~:text=%22NC%22%20grade-,May%2015,lapse%20of%20INC%20to%20FIN%20from%20Fall%202023%20and%20Winter%202024,-May%2015" target="_blank">Academic Calendar</a>. 
                All missing coursework must be completed no later than the deadline posted on the Academic Calendar. If your work 
                is not submitted by that deadline, your "INC" grade will become a "FIN" grade. A "FIN" grade factors into your GPA as 
                an "F" (Failure) grade, and faculty may not be able to change it into another letter grade after the deadline.
                Due to the fact that "FIN" grades are treated as "F" grades, they will negatively affect GPA, and can impact
                financial aid status.
            </p>

            <p>
                "FIN" grades are avoidable. If you have obtained an "INC" grade, make sure to complete all work assigned by your 
                instructor by the appropriate deadlines in order to earn your standard letter grade.
            </p>
