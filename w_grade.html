            <!-- General Information -->
            <h3>You Should Know</h3>
            <p>
                The "W" (Withdrawal) grade is assigned when a student officially withdraws from a class between the 4th and final weeks 
                of classes. The student must complete the withdrawal process by the withdrawal deadline, which is published on the BMCC
                <a href="https://www.bmcc.cuny.edu/academics/academic-calendar/spring-regular-2024/#:~:text=and%20Winter%202024-,May%2015,Last%20day%20to%20withdraw%20with%20a%20grade%20of%20%22W%22,-May%2015" target="_blank">Academic Calendar</a>. 
                "W" grades do not hurt your GPA, but they remain on your transcript without reason for withdrawal.
            </p>

            <p>
                While GPA is not impacted by 
                this grade, consider using "W" grades sparingly as multiple "W" grades might raise questions during transfer and/or grad school 
                applications. Remember, there are deadlines to withdraw with a "W", missing them could result in a failing grade. Additionally, 
                even though "W" grades won't affect gpa, they can delay graduation and impact financial aid.

                Before withdrawing, consider discussing your situation with your professor. They can offer alternative solutions like 
                tutoring or changing sections and help you understand the implications of withdrawing.
