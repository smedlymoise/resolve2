            <!-- General Information -->
            <h3>You Should Know</h3>
            <p>
                The "NC" (No Credit) grade is assigned when eligible students apply for the grade and are approved. It is 
                an option for freshmen (with no more than 30 credits) and nursing students (2nd-4th semesters) under specific 
                conditions. You can apply for NC in courses with a failing grade (C- or below) but must still attend class, 
                complete assignments, and take the exam. There is a deadline to opt-in for this grade, which can be found on the BMCC
                <a href="https://www.bmcc.cuny.edu/academics/academic-calendar/spring-regular-2024/#:~:text=Evaluations%20submission%20deadline-,May%2015,Last%20day%20to%20opt%20for%20an%20%22NC%22%20grade,-May%2015" target="_blank">Academic Calendar</a>. 
                A maximum of 8 credits, or 2 classes, can qualify for this grade.
            </p>

            <p>
                "NC" grades do not hurt your GPA, but they remain on your transcript. While GPA is not impacted by 
                this grade, consider using "NC" grades sparingly as multiple "NC" grades might raise questions during transfer 
                and/or grad school applications. In some cases, other schools may even consider an "NC" grade to be equivalent 
                to an "F" grade. Additionally, even though "NC" grades won't affect gpa, they can delay graduation and impact 
                financial aid.
            </p>
