            <!-- General Information -->
            <h3>You Should Know</h3>
            <p>
                The "INC" (Incomplete) grade is assigned when a Semester/Term's work is incomplete. The instructor has reasonable 
                expectations that the student can receive a passing grade after completing the missing assignment(s), and agrees to 
                work with the student to make up the missing work. The Student must agree with the faculty to make up the missing work 
                before the "INC" deadline, which is published on the BMCC
                <a href="https://www.bmcc.cuny.edu/academics/academic-calendar/spring-regular-2024/#:~:text=%22NC%22%20grade-,May%2015,lapse%20of%20INC%20to%20FIN%20from%20Fall%202023%20and%20Winter%202024,-May%2015" target="_blank">Academic Calendar</a>.
            </p>

            <p>
                The “INC” grade converts into a 
                <a href="fin_grade.html" target="_blank">“FIN” grade</a> 
                if all responsibilities assigned to the student by the
                instructor are not met by the "INC" deadline. "FIN" grades are treated as "F" (Failure) grades and will have negative
                consequences on GPA. They may also impact financial aid status, and cause you to not meet graduation requirements.
                Be mindful of the fact that the "INC" deadline may vary depending on the semester. Typically, If an "INC" grade is 
                assigned to a student for a class that took place in the Fall semester, the "INC" deadline for that student will fall 
                sometime in the Spring semester, and vice versa. Refer to the Academic Calendar to learn when this deadline may be for
                you.
            </p>

            <p>
                Remember to reach out to your professor to confirm what work must be completed and by when, in order to earn a standard 
                letter grade. Make sure to have this information stored somewhere that is readily available should you ever need it again.
                All missing coursework must be completed no later than the deadline posted on the Academic Calendar. If your work is not 
                submitted by that deadline, your "INC" grade will become a "FIN" grade, and faculty may not be able to change it into another 
                letter grade after the deadline.
            </p>
